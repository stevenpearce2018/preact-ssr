# SSR Preact App

This is an example of a Preact app being rendered on the server side. It uses [Unistore](https://github.com/developit/unistore) to manage state, [preact-router](https://github.com/developit/preact-router) to manage routes and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle JS files.

You can start the app with the command: `npm run dev`
